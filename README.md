# neutrinoAPI-Python
a python package for the website neutrinoapi.com

The API is depreacated as it was made for python 2.7 and I couldnt really figure out how to use the new one....

This is not tied to neutrinoAPI.com in any way
just a project I wanted to do to make accesssing it easyer to use neutrino api with python
